<h1>Highlights</h1>

<p>Below is a selection of highlights which illustrate the presence of internet censorship and/or traffic manipulation within certain countries.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-3 ooni-highlight">
    <p><span class="ooni-highlight-number">8.5</span> million network measurements have been collected across <span class="ooni-highlight-number">91</span> countries around the world in <span class="ooni-highlight-number">3</span> years (from late 2012 to early 2016).</p>

  <div class="col-3 ooni-highlight">
  <p><strong>Network anomalies</strong> have been detected in <span class="ooni-highlight-number">71</span> out of 91 tested countries.</p>
  <p>However, not all network anomalies are necessarily cases of censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p>

    <p><span class="ooni-highlight-number">9</span> countries have <strong>confirmed cases of censorship</strong>: <strong><a href="/country/RU">Russia</a>, <a href="/country/CN">China</a>, <a href="/country/IR">Iran</a>, <a href="/country/SA">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="/country/TR">Turkey</a>, <a href="/country/IN">India</a>, <a href="/country/ID">Indonesia</a>, <a href="/country/GR">Greece</a></strong> and <a href="/country/SD">Sudan</a>.</p>
    <p>By "confirmed censorship" we mean that we have an accurate heuristic to determine when blocking is occurring. Generally this means that we are looking for a block page in the response body of a HTTP request test.</p>

  <div class="col-3 ooni-highlight">
    <p><span class="ooni-highlight-number">3</span> vendors have been identified through our network measurements: <strong>Blue Coat, Squid and Privoxy</strong>. The use of their software has been detected in <span class="ooni-highlight-number">11</span> countries around the world: <strong><a href="/country/US">USA</a>, <a href="/country/CA">Canada</a>, <a href="/country/PT">Portugal</a>, <a href="/country/ES">Spain</a>, <a href="/country/IT">Italy</a>, <a href="/country/NL">the Netherlands</a>, <a href="/country/CH">Switzerland</a>, <a href="/country/MD">Moldova</a>, <a href="/country/IQ">Iraq</a>, <a href="/country/UG">Uganda</a> and <a href="/country/MM">Myanmar</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>Such software may or may not have been responsible for online censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p>

      <h3>Iran</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Through our (HTTP request) tests in Iran, we detected <span class="ooni-highlight-number">362</span> blocked websites, including <strong><a href="/website/www.iranrights.org/">www.iranrights.org</a>, <a href="/website/www.iranpressnews.com">www.iranpressnews.com</a> and <a href="/website/www.iransocialforum.org">www.iransocialforum.org</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>However, our Psiphon tests showed that access to Psiphon was <strong>not</strong> blocked in Iran and this proxy can potentially still be used for accessing blocked websites.</p>

      <h3>Uganda</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Following reports that Facebook and Twitter were blocked in Uganda leading up to its 2016 general elections, OONI tests were run in the country. While we were unable to detect block pages, the following are possibilities:
    <ul>
      <li>Facebook and Twitter were only blocked in specific networks (excluding the one we tested), and not countrywide.</li>
      <li>Ugandan ISPs did not forward their users' requests to connect to the servers of Facebook and Twitter.</li>
      <li>Ugandan ISPs chose to block some requests, while not others. Over the last three years of conducting network measurments, we have noticed that this often appears to be a common practice of censorship by ISPs around the world.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Myanmar</h3>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Blue Coat</strong> software (some types of which can potenially be used for internet filtering, censorship and surveillance) was detected in Myanmar through one of our (HTTP-field-manipulation) tests in late 2012. It's unclear, however, if this was a countrywide deployment or if it was only used in the specific network that we tested.</p>
    <p>Two years later we ran the same test in the same network in Myanmar, but did not detect the presence of Blue Coat.</p>

      <h3>Cuba</h3>
    </div>
    <p>While we did not detect any block pages in Cuba, many websites triggered connectivity errors. Such websites include <strong><a href="/website/www.cubafreepress.org">www.cubafreepress.org</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/website/www.cubademocraciayvida.org">www.cubademocraciayvida.org</a></strong>, which were likely censored.</p>

      <h3>India</h3>
    </div>
    <p>In January 2015 the Government of India <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/government-wants-32-urls-including-dailymotion-vimeo-banned-in-india/">ordered</a> Internet Service Licensees to <strong>block 32 websites</strong> under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and under the Information Technology (Procedures and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009.</p>

    <p>We ran network measurements on those 32 websites and detected block pages (confirmed cases of censorship) for <span class="ooni-highlight-number">23</span> of them, including <strong>dailymotion.com</strong>, <strong>pastebin.com</strong> and <strong>archive.org</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Pakistan</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Multiple (HTTP-invalid-request-line) tests conducted in Pakistan show that "middle boxes" (software which could potentially be used for censorship and/or traffic manipulation) were present in Pakistani networks. However, it remains unclear if such software was actually used for the purpose of censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p>

    <p>Multiple (HTTP-invalid-request-line) tests conducted in Vietnam from 2013 to 2015 show that "middle boxes" (software which could potentially be used for censorship and/or traffic manipulation) were present in Vietnamese networks. However, it remains unclear if such software was actually used for the purpose of censorship and/or traffic manipulation.</p>
