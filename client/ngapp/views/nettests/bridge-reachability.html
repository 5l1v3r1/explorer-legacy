            <h3>What does this test do?</h3>

            <p>This test examines whether Tor bridges work in tested networks.</p> 

            <p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> is free and open
            source software which enables online anonymity and censorship
            circumvention. It was designed to bounce communications around a
            distributed network of relays run by volunteers around the world,
            thus hiding users' IP address and circumventing online tracking and
            censorship. However, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in various
            countries around the world are often ordered by their governments
            to block users' access to Tor. As a result,
            <strong><a href="https://bridges.torproject.org/">Tor bridges</a></strong> were developed to enable users to
            connect to the Tor network in countries where such access is blocked.</p>


            <p>This test runs Tor with a list of bridges and if it's able to connect to
            them successfully, we consider that Tor bridges are not blocked in the tested
            network. If the test, however, is unable to bootstrap a connection, then the
            Tor bridges are either offline or blocked.</p>
