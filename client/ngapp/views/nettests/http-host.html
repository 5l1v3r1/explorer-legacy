            <h3>What does this test do?</h3>

            <p>This test attempts to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>examine whether the domain names of websites are blocked</li>
              <li>detect the presence of “middle boxes” (software which could be used for censorship and/or traffic manipulation) in tested networks</li>
              <li>assess which censorship circumvention techniques are capable of bypassing the censorship implemented by the “middle box”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>HTTP is a protocol which transfers or exchanges data across the internet. It
            does so by handling a client's request to connect to a server, and a server's
            response to a client's request. Every time you connect to a server, you (the
            client) send a request through the HTTP protocol to that server. Such requests
            include “HTTP headers”, some of which (the “Host header”) include information
            about the specific domain that you want to connect to. When you connect to
            torproject.org, for example, the host header of your HTTP request includes
            information which communicates that you want to connect to that domain.</p>

            <p>This test implements a series of techniques which help it evade getting
            detected from censors and then uses a list of domain names (such as bbc.co.uk)
            to connect to an OONI backend control server, which sends a JSON structure
            containing the host headers of those domain names back to us. If a “middle box”
            is detected between the network path of the probe and the OONI backend control
            server, its fingerprint might be included in the JSON data that we receive from
            the backend control server. Such data also informs us if the tested domain
            names are blocked or not, as well as how the censor tried to fingerprint the
            censorship of those domains. This can sometimes lead to the identification of
            the type of infrastructure being used to implement censorship.</p>

            <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The presence of a middle box is not necessarily
            indicative of censorship and/or traffic manipulation, as they are often used in
            networks for caching purposes.</p>
