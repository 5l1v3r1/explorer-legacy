          <h3>Lantern Circumvention Tool</h3>

            <p>This test provides an automated way of examining whether Lantern works in a tested network.</p>

            <p><a href="https://getlantern.org/">Lantern</a> is a centralized and
            peer-to-peer proxy, which is used as a circumvention tool. It detects whether
            websites are blocked and, if so, it allows you to access them via Lantern
            servers or via the network of Lantern users.</p>

            <p>This test runs Lantern and checks to see if it is working. If it's
            able to connect to a Lantern server and reach a control website over it,
            then we consider that Lantern can be used for censorship circumvention
            within the tested network. If however the test is unable to connect
            to Lantern servers, then it is likely the case that they are blocked
            within the tested network.</p>
