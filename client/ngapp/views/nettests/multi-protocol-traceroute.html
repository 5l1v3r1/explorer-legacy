            <h3>What does this test do?</h3>

            <p>
            This test looks at what paths packets take when establishing connections based on certain protocols and port combinations. ICMP traceroutes: often they are treated differently than using the TCP or other protocols. Also they are effected by the types of ports that you use. Multi-protocol traceroutes, on the other hand, perform a traceroute on various different ports and protocols simultaneously. OONI constructs packets in such a way that they perform a traceroute from multiple protocols and paths simultaneously.
