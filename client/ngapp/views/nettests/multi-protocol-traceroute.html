            <h3>Multi-Protocol Traceroute</h3>
            <p>
            Every time we connect to a server, our devices make requests which are encapsulated in a packet. A traceroute is a way of understanding which paths packets take in a network. OONI constructs packets in such a way that they perform a traceroute from multiple protocols and ports simultaneously, in an attempt to detect traffic manipulation.
