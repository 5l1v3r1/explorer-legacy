            <h3>What does this test do?</h3>

            <p>This test provides an automated way of examining whether OpenVPN works in a tested network.</p> 

<p><a href="https://openvpn.net/">OpenVPN</a> is an open source application that implements VPN techniques for censorship circumvention.</p>

<p>This test runs OpenVPN and checks to see if it is working. If it's able to connect to an OpenVPN server, then we consider that OpenVPN can be used for censorship circumvention within the tested network. If however the test is unable to connect to OpenVPN servers, then it is likely the case that they are blocked within the tested network.</p>
